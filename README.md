# Cantilever_sfd_bmd_calculation
MATLAB Code to calculate and plot S.F. and B.M. diagram in a cantilever beam subjected to at least two concentrated loads and Udl along its part or complete span. 

# Working with this code
Open matlab and create a new script then copy this code. It will ask for the following prompts
Is cantilever fixed from LHS or from RHS?
Unit of length and Force?
Number of concentrated load?
Number of Unigormly Distributed Load?
Value of concentrated load with sign? (Take downward direction as positive as usually downwards load acts on a cantilever)
Values of Udl with sign?
Length of Udl?
Distance of Udl from LHS?
Distance of Concentrated load from LHS?
